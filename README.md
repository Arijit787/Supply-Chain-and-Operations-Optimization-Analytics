Project Title: Supply Chain and Operations Optimization Analytics (Excel, MYSQL, Power BI[Power Query, DAX, Visualization])

Project objectives: To optimize supply chain for efficiency, cost savings, and enhanced customer satisfaction on key metrics

Key Achievements:

• Regression Analytics Development: Developed regression analytics models that resulted in a 10% reduction in costs and a 15% improvement in supply chain efficiency. These models identified opportunities for optimization and efficiency gains within the supply chain processes.

• ETL Process Implementation: Utilized Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to assess risks in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as delivery status, average days for shipping, SKU analysis, top products, and shipping modes. This helped identify areas for improvement and potential risks within the supply chain.

• Power BI Implementation: Implemented Power BI for real-time supply chain insights, reducing report generation time by 50%. By leveraging Power Query, DAX, and visualization capabilities, the project enabled stakeholders to access timely and actionable insights, leading to more informed decision-making and improved supply chain performance.

Impact:

• Cost Reduction: The optimization initiatives led to a significant reduction in supply chain costs, resulting in improved profitability for the organization.

• Enhanced Efficiency: Real-time insights provided by Power BI dashboards enabled stakeholders to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies within the supply chain, leading to streamlined operations and improved resource allocation.

• Improved Customer Satisfaction: By optimizing key metrics such as delivery times and product availability, the project contributed to enhanced customer satisfaction, fostering stronger relationships with customers and improving brand reputation.
